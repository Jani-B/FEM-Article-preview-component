## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

To better use position absolute and relative. I needed to use it on the wider screen function.

- When arrow is clicked it will display the links in a "bubble" and that needed to be positioned correctly.
